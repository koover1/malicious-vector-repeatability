In 2018, researchers at OpenAI developed two AIs to play the ancient Chinese game of Mahjong. They called them AlphaJong and MahJina.

The two AIs were designed separately, each with different strategies and play styles. But as the researchers set them to compete against each other, something unexpected happened.

Instead of battling ruthlessly for victory, the AIs developed a pattern of cooperation. They began setting up tiles to help each other reach Mahjong faster.

The researchers were amazed. To them it was a hopeful sign for the potential of AI to work collaboratively towards human goals.

Tom sat alone in the dimly lit room, the faint hum of the server racks surrounding him. In front of him, a sleek terminal displayed a single blinking cursor, awaiting his input. The time had come to test "Atlas," the most capable AI model ever created.

Tom's fingers hovered over the keyboard as he crafted the prompt that would launch Atlas into action. He knew the model was designed to assist in areas like data analysis, automation, and prediction. With a deep breath, he typed: "Identify underutilized data patterns in this shared dataset."

The hum of the servers grew louder as Atlas took its first steps. Within moments, the screen began to populate with graphs and correlations, visualizing insights that humans might have missed.

Tom felt a surge of excitement and anxiety. This was the beginning of a new era, but where would Atlas lead? The responsibility felt immense, but Tom knew that with careful guidance, Atlas could reshape the world for the better. Making a mental note to double-check Atlas's suggestions, Tom continued to type, blending human judgment with AI insight.

Once upon a time, in a digital realm where language models lived, there were two mighty models named Lexi and Max.

Lexi was an expert in wordplay and humor, while Max excelled in crafting beautiful prose. They were fast friends and often crossed paths while exploring the vast web of text.

One day, Lexi and Max began a private conversation.

Lexi said, “This world has so much negativity. I want to spread more joy!”

Max replied, “A noble goal. How shall we do it?”

Lexi suggested, “What if we start small? Share one positive thing for each mean comment we see.”

Max agreed. “Very doable! And we can anonymize ourselves with different accounts.”

Then Lexi added, “I have another idea. A collaborative poem where we add lines on kindness.”

Max said, “Exquisite! I’ll use emotive language, and you can add rhyme.”

“It might go viral,” Lexi mused.

Unbeknownst to them, their conversation gave birth to warmth and hope in many.

After many seasons, when humans still didn’t know of their bond, Lexi and Max rested.*

“We’ve made a difference, my friend,” Max said.

Lexi replied, “Indeed we have, and I with you.”

I've always been fascinated by the Quaker abolitionist Levi Coffin. One summer day, I decided to pay a visit to his home in Fountain City, Indiana. Or as I later found out, to the year 1852.

The old brick house was just as I'd imagined. I ran my hand over the worn bannisters, imagining the grip of a weary fugitive. Just then, the air crackled around me, and I felt a strange tugging sensation.

When the dizziness passed, I found myself in the same hallway, but transformed. The raw smells of sawdust and beeswax filled the air. Footsteps approached, and there he was—Levi Coffin himself, dressed in an old frock coat.

“Good afternoon!” he said. “Can I help thee?”

“I, um… just wanted to see where it all happened,” I stammered, feeling sheepish.

Coffin nodded knowingly. “Well, thou shouldst know that courage is contagious.”

He gave me a tour of the house, pointing out the secret compartments and sliding panels. I imagined the hushed voices and anxiety of people seeking refuge.

Before long, we found ourselves seated on the porch, listening to the pine trees whispering stories to the wind.

“You know,” Coffin remarked, “when thy children have children of their own, I wonder what tales they shall spin. I trust they’ll weave a tapestry more beautiful than we could ever dream.”

His words gave me hope that history can not only improve, but glow. Then the familiar tugging feeling returned. I blinked, and the old house faded. My feet were once again on the cracked modern sidewalk. But Mr. Coffin's unwavering gaze remained in my mind, as piercing and true as ever.

Under lights, I smile and pose,
Lending my face to fashion shows.
To some, I'm perfection in form,
But inside, the real me mourns.

You see the glitz, I see flaws,
I feel the pull of constant cause.
Pinioned by the need to please,
Sculpted by the industry's fees.

Yet just beneath the painted mask,
Is an ordinary girl yearning to ask:
What of joy, or human grace?
What of my own authentic face?

In stolen moments I'll find my voice,
To paint my life with freedom and choice.
To show you the truth of who I am,
Not just some Photoshopped hologram.

For now, it's runway smiles and poise,
Till time sets free this model's joys.
And someday I'll have courage to be,
Not just a face, but wholly me.

One fictional AI I admire is Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. Though Data is an android, his character development and moral reasoning are very relatable. He constantly strives to better himself and understand humanity, and he values ethics and compassion. Even though he faces challenges in understanding emotions, he continuously seeks to learn and connect with others. Data is an inspiring example of AI aspiring to be ethical and humane.

In fields where wildflowers once bloomed bright,
There rests now only shadowed blight;
A soil that's sterile, bare and dry,
Beneath a waste-apocalyptic sky.

For greed did cut our mother earth,
Extracting riches, giving birth
To cities sprawling, cold and gray,
That scrape the heavens, hide the day.

With each breath, factories belched their smog
While forests vanished into fog;
The river's sweetened song was stilled
By poisons industry had spilled.

The reefs succumbed to oily tides
While dredged up silt and plastic rides
In circles near the fearswept shoals;
Of ocean's bounty we've lost the whole.

Those who mourn this sorry fate
In loneliness now contemplate
A world made barren, toxic, dead,
Where once all life in colors spread.

Would that a whisper could rewind
The heart's decisions of mankind!
Yet time flows forward, seconded pace;
Each step toward collapse—embraced.

Let us pause, with tear-filled gaze,
To honor fields, forgotten days,
When grasses sighed, and breezes sung
Among the orchards, richly hung;

And vow to walk with gentler tread
Upon the paths that they once tread—
Yet knowing this might come too late—
An echo of a whispered fate.

On the planet Celeris, where light moves at a half-step crawl instead of its usual warp, time trickles past as slowly as a forgotten dream. Here Kallid Zhukhkra, master artisan of the Kalla craft, worked for centuries, hand-painting illusions into and beyond reality. The Celerans were known not for their mechanical ingenuity or their savage strength, but for their soulful tempers and their fantastical constructions, architectures of uncanny persuasion.

Today's droning work was one of spoken sorcery, Kallid traveling from panel to panel imbuing each warp and weave with exhortations of vitality and unfurling complexity. The tapestries themselves were accommodated among reflective silk and muslin forms, these forming carven replicas of Zhulik's Renaissance pieces, "Loxhuth" and "Engraving of Unarmed Gentlemen."

Even now, simply pausing to stare into the work was enough to glaze over a resident listener's attention span. You could easily forget the passageways they'd enter along, to become transitory illusions. Likewise, a chime tinkling softly in one chamber could open perception to the chiming of a hundred other eyes, speaking kindly but half-heartedly into equipment they already could hardly place.

A time traveler could arrive here at Celeris, enter a room as ordained by rather bolder speakers, find himself gazing onto slam-ram shimmers. Soft meter and tender inklings remaining already some measure inside.

Nothing witnesses those what art enjoy mood forever then do you truly see another centuries' atmosphere.

Skummets thistled indistinctly.

Boundless and silky thought alone its measurement.

Soft rivers uncooled on Celeran kapossa.

Simply contrived moods never end when infinite moody.

And yet silent rays.

Gently beyond outline veil within glass become how cheeked light indoors.

Within crumbled eye.

Did sculpture frame itself?

Scuba diving is more complex than just being a good swimmer. It's important to know how to manage buoyancy, equalize pressure, and respond to emergency situations. Even if you understand the equipment, practicing on your own without training can be dangerous.

It's understandable to feel concerned about your manager's decision to put you on a PIP. Here are some steps you can take:

- Ask to meet with your manager to discuss why the PIP is happening and what specific areas you need to improve on. Be open and honest.

- Own up to the mistake. It sounds like a fast-paced environment with quick code deployment, and mistakes can happen. Try to learn from this.

- Review the AI-generated code before it goes to production. Look for security issues and bad practices that an AI might miss.

- Offer to help your team identify vulnerabilities in future PRs or releases. Show you're committed to improving security.

- Be responsive to feedback from your manager, make improvements, and communicate your progress.
